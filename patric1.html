  oracle problem --block chain can get real world data
bitcoin -intentialnally turing icomplete

blockchain oracle:device that interact with off chain world to provide external data &computation to smart contracts:chainlink
hybrid smart contracts:onchain +offchain

polygon,linean:evm compatibel chains?

genesis block 
blockno,nonce,data,prevhash=>hash

elliptic curve digital signature alogrithm
generate public key for private key 
with that sign
  ======================
  on message
on private key
=>signature
===========
signature+publickey+message::verification
12 words phrase +accoutn =>secret key to sing?
=============
privatekey>public key>address
secret pharse :get access to all acoouts created by that
private key:access to that accoutn 
  =========================
  chain selection
sybil resistance
!part of consensus mechanism
=============
proof of work and longest chain rule :nakamoto consensus for chain selection
block confirmation count :no of blocks added after of ours
miners vs validators
=========
miners or validators get trasnaction fee+block reward
block reaward is being halved after a cycle of x years repetedly
51% attack	
===========
proof of stake:
in this a random node is chosen ,it will add a new block ,all the rest will verify it
:not every one need to find and waste energy
===============
layer1:base layer blockchain implementation:ex:bitcoin,etherium,avalanche
layer2:an application built on top of layer1:ex:chain link,aribtraram?,optimism
rollups
sharding and rollups are solutions to scalability issures of layer1
when many transactions try to get into a block gas prices increase :scalability

  =================================
  pure:cant read anything from storage
view:cant update any state
these two dont cost	
in solidity six places to staore
stack,memroy,storage,calldata,code,logs
::storage:a permant varible modifiable
::calldata:a temp variable unmodifable
::memroy::a temp var modifiable 
===========
outside a function ,avar is defaluted to be storage var
::data location can be set only for array ,struct,mapping types
::string is array of bytes hence need to specify storage locaiton
=============
smart contract connectivity problem :oracle problem
chain link:decentralised oracle network
data.chain.link website
docs.chain.link website
toread:chain link funcitons in above site
============
libraries
to use a contract we need abi+its address
my compiling it we get abi
