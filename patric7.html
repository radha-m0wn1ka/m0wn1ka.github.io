1991
bit gold decentralied digital currency 1998
2008 bitcoin, application of block chain ,first crypto currency,solved the problem of double spending
2013 etherium developed ,new crypto currncy
2014 by now hundreds of crypto currencies
-------------
block chani is a multi purpose tool
currenly it is used to build applications
distributed ledger --data is copied  in multiple computers
each block points to previous block
block chain-- each block is divided into sevaral fields ,in each field a transaction is saved
it is a append only database(difficult to delete)
def::--------
a block chanin is essentially a database where info is chronologically stored in a continuoulsy
growing chain of data blocks,implemented in a decentralized netwrok in a way
that creates data integrity truest and scurtiy for
the nodes without the need for central authorieies or intermediators
----a global spreadsheet
incoruptible digital ledger where data can be  represented shared transacted
==continuosly growing list of records called blocks which are linked secured using cryptography
--------------------
centralised---
single ownere,fullcontrol,more prone to attacks,third party involvement is presen,
easy to implement,vertical scaling,client server architecture
decentralised---no single owner,no single point of failure,data is replicated on 
different central servers,users can access data from other server if one failes
distributed----
no control of anyone all  have equla rights
computation is disributed acroos components
each node interact with each other by meseage passing
peer to peer network 
geopgraphically distributed
---------------------------------
consensus or mutual agreement
when some complex algorithms are solved then only the data becomes part of block

cryptogrphic hashing makes blockchain secure
some use bucket hasing some toher 
smart contract self executable code	which executes itself on every transacion processing
--------

------------------
public-permisionless,any one can use,read ,write,users are anonymours,	full decenrrailed,slow transperency
private-permisssioned,single organisation,paritally decentaliesd	
consortium-permissioned(Flexibility)
-----------------
consensus alogrithms :proof of work ,proof of stake
byzantine general problem
miners:these decide whether a block can join a chain or not
miners have to use computational power to craete a hash or nance which is less than target hash,then the value is passed to other blocks if the agree it is correnct ,then the block can join
miners are rewarded for doing computations correct,bit coin,litecoin	
proof of stacke:orobros,nxt,ppcoin,u loose  money if u give somethig wrong
    roof-of-stake is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism for processing
 transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain. A consensus mechanism 
is a method for validating entries into a distributed database and keeping the 
database secure. In the case of cryptocurrency, the database is called a blockchainâ€”
so the consensus mechanism secures the blockchain.
----------------
proof of work -u do calculations,u add node,u get bitcoin as reward in blockchain
-----------bitcoin-cryptocurrency
ethereum a open source platoform ,for decentralised applications
------------------------------------
proof of work -miners-use most energy,all compete,mining,mining pools are dangerous,51%attack
proof of stacke,select some node randomly ,validator,minting or forging,
